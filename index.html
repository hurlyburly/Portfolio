                        <p>But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? No… but I'd like to be asked!
                            I hear the jury's still out on science. Marry me. Bad news. Andy Griffith turned us down. He
                            didn't like his trailer. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. I'm a monster.
                            Get me a vodka rocks. And a piece of toast. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to
                            oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to
                            hide. Marry me. Well, what do you expect, mother? Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. We
                            just call it a sausage. There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle
                            Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. Say goodbye to these, because it's the
                            last time! That's why you always leave a note! Well, what do you expect, mother? Now, when you
                            do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Well, what do you expect,
                            mother? Army had half a day. I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it. Now,
                            when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Michael! Say goodbye
                            to these, because it's the last time! I'm a monster. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. He'll
                            want to use your yacht, and I don't want this thing smelling like fish. I'm afraid I just blue
                            myself. I've opened a door here that I regret. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Marry me.
                            First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. Oh, you're gonna be in
                            a coma, all right. No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. I've opened
                            a door here that I regret. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I'm half machine.
                            I'm a monster. Did you enjoy your meal, Mom? You drank it fast enough. Well, what do you expect,

                            this thing smelling like fish. Whoa, this guy's straight? I care deeply for nature. Whoa, this
                            guy's straight? That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' That's

                            or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. I care deeply for nature. No…
                            but I'd like to be asked! Well, what do you expect, mother? But I bought a yearbook ad from you,

                            it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' Michael! I'm a monster.</p>
